	When playing a fighting game, there are multiple motions that are required to be able to perform adequately. Before going over even just the motion, newcomers should be aware of what is known as the notepad notation.
	This is the notation that is written to understand the motion. In order to visualize this motion you can use the number pad on your computer or a phone as a reference. 5 would be the resting position of your joystick or controller stick. Any direction is a number but the positioning of your character is important for the notation.
	For example the 6 would be commonly known as forward for a player that is starting on the left and facing right, but if your character is on the right, facing left then you would actually move your stick to the left - 4. Keep this in mind that you would have to reverse the direction of many motions because there are specific notations for both directions.

	<div class=container style="border:2px solid #150">
	One of the more easier and earliest motion that is used for special moves is commonly called a fireball motion. This is in reference to Street Fighter using the motion for a fireball projectile. Many others also refer to it as a quarter-circle forward motion.
	</div>
	<div class=container style="border: 2px solid#1456">
	The notation is 236. Simply put it is to put the control stick in the down position and then roll it forward, which is why it's called a quarter-cricle forward. If your character is facing left then its 214. When beginning this motion can seem to be very difficult to perform especially because most fighting game engines require you to do it in a single motion.
	Practice is important as in a regular match you would have to do this motion in real-time. In many games a button would follow this command such as 236A. 
	</div>
	<div class=container style="border: 2px solid#2456">
	The 'A' stands for a button, many games use different systems for these buttons. The modern Street Fighters adapt a Light, medium, heavy button system. This involves a light punch and a light kick. LP (Light Punch), MP (Medium Punch), HP (Heavy Punch) and the same set for kicks, LK, MK, HK. Other games such as the Marvel vs Capcom series use a different system - a light, medium, heavy and launcher. 
	So following the 236 motion you would be required to push a button - 'A'. A is usually the light attack in most notations but it varies between games.
