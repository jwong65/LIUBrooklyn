	When playing a fighting game, there are multiple motions that are required to be able to perform adequately. Before going over even just the motion, newcomers should be aware of what is known as the notepad notation.
	This is the notation that is written to understand the motion. In order to visualize this motion you can use the number pad on your computer or a phone as a reference. 5 would be the resting position of your joystick or controller stick. Any direction is a number but the positioning of your character is important for the notation.
	For example the 6 would be commonly known as forward for a player that is starting on the left and facing right, but if your character is on the right, facing left then you would actually move your stick to the left - 4. Keep this in mind that you would have to reverse the direction of many motions because there are specific notations for both directions.

	To illustrate how this notation can be used, I'll write out a few notations for combos that you might have to read. This is important because many sites when learning a certain game, these strings of buttons may show up to write out a combo sequence. If a sequence has a "j" in front of it, that notes a jumping button. LP is light punch, MP for medium, HP for heavy. The same for LK, MK, and HK.

			This first combo is a bread-and-butter (BnB) combo that I devised for Peacock in Skullgirls. It can start with standing A (Light) or jumping B (Medium). It is harder to do with any crounching normals but can be connected depending on the character it is used against.
			
			LP, LP, MP, 2MK, HK, jLP, jMP, Air-dash, jLP, jMP, MP, 2MK, 236 HP, HP, HP, 236 236 LP/MP/HP.

			This is a second combo used by Hsien-Ko in UMvC3. Most characters use the same system for combos but Hsien-Ko is the limited of the entire cast.
			
			A, B, C, Launch (Or S), jB, jB, jC, 623 623 AB.
			</div>
			<div class="col-sm">
			This third combo is another one used by Peacock. It was one of the most optimized combos I created for the solo play of Peacock and is universal with multiple reset options. These resets are opportunities to catch your opponent off guard- for another high/low mix-up and another opening for another combo. For simplicity this will not show those resets.
			
			LP, LP, 2LK, 2MK, MK, jLP, jMP, Air-dash, jLP, jMP, LP, LP, 2MK, HK, 314 HP(Hold button), 236 236 LP/MP, (release button), if in corner- 236 LK, 236 MP, HK, 236 236 LP/MP/HP. If not in corner, on button release 236 236 LP/MP/HP again.
