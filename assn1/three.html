		The 623 motion is considered to be a staple in many fighting game systems. This motion is also known as the shoryuken/uppercut motion, as its commonly used for uppercuts like in Street Fighter.
		The uppercut has invincibility frames and is typically used as an option to get opponents to break off on pressure. In more recent fighting games, it is also used as an option off the wake-up, or when your character is coming off a knockdown.

		This picture is a common symbol that is used for this motion. At first glance it is a very intimidating motion to be able to pull off in real time.
		For myself - I was very discouraged in using characters where this motion was integral to their moveset - whether its a combo-ender or an option.
		When I began playing Skullgirls at a competitive level, I realized that it was going to be necessary as the motion is used in many different games. 
		The character I stuck with, Peacock has an attack doesn't use this motion.
