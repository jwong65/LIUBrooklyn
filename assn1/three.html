		The 623 motion is considered to be a staple in many fighting game systems. This motion is also known as the shoryuken/uppercut motion, as its commonly used for uppercuts like in Street Fighter.
		The uppercut has invincibility frames and is typically used as an option to get opponents to break off on pressure. In more recent fighting games, it is also used as an option off the wake-up, or when your character is coming off a knockdown.

		This picture is a common symbol that is used for this motion. At first glance it is a very intimidating motion to be able to pull off in real time.
		For myself - I was very discouraged in using characters where this motion was integral to their moveset - whether its a combo-ender or an option.
		When I began playing Skullgirls at a competitive level, I realized that it was going to be necessary as the motion is used in many different games. 
		The character I stuck with, Peacock has an attack doesn't use this motion, which was one of the reasons why I enjoyed playing her.

		As confusing as the S may seem, you may find a character you enjoy that requires this motion. I found characters in Melty Blood and UNIEL that used this command and I had to learn the command.
		For beginners, you need to put 6 on your stick. Some games allow for a buffer, so while a button is out, like an attack you can buffer the motion. Once you push forward on the stick or 6, you must go back to 2.
		You may want to reset the stick to neutral for a brief moment before going to 2, but not take too long before the input has passed. Using training modes can let you get a grasp for the timing and what is needed to pull this off.
		Once you are at 2 you need to move down-forward to 3. For myself I found this S or Z pattern on the stick to be jarring, but thought of it as going forward and then making another quarter circle.
		In reality that motion is 6236. Some games recognize this motion as the same as 623, because the last forward doesn't correspond to another button for the character. If not then you will need to be able to recognize the notch for down forward before you press a button to complete the 623.
		When done quickly it is like a churning motion but not like a full circle or a half circle like 63214.
