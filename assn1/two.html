	One of the more easier and earliest motion that is used for special moves is commonly called a fireball motion. This is in reference to Street Fighter using the motion for a fireball projectile. Many others also refer to it as a quarter-circle forward motion.
	</div>
	<div class=container style="">
	The notation is 236. Simply put it is to put the control stick in the down position and then roll it forward, which is why it's called a quarter-cricle forward. If your character is facing left then its 214. When beginning this motion can seem to be very difficult to perform especially because most fighting game engines require you to do it in a single motion.
	Practice is important as in a regular match you would have to do this motion in real-time. In many games a button would follow this command such as 236A. 
	</div>
	<div class=container style="">
	The 'A' stands for a button, many games use different systems for these buttons. The modern Street Fighters adapt a Light, medium, heavy button system. This involves a light punch and a light kick. LP (Light Punch), MP (Medium Punch), HP (Heavy Punch) and the same set for kicks, LK, MK, HK. Other games such as the Marvel vs Capcom series use a different system - a light, medium, heavy and launcher. 
	So following the 236 motion you would be required to push a button - 'A'. A is usually the light attack in most notations but it varies between games.
