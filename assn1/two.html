	One of the more easier and earliest motion that is used for special moves is commonly called a fireball motion. This is in reference to Street Fighter using the motion for a fireball projectile. Many others also refer to it as a quarter-circle forward motion.
	</div>
	<div class=container style="">
	The notation is 236. Simply put it is to put the control stick in the down position and then roll it forward, which is why it's called a quarter-cricle forward. If your character is facing left then its 214. When beginning this motion can seem to be very difficult to perform especially because most fighting game engines require you to do it in a single motion.
	Practice is important as in a regular match you would have to do this motion in real-time. In many games a button would follow this command such as 236A. 
	</div>
	<div class=container style="">
	The 'A' stands for a button, many games use different systems for these buttons. The modern Street Fighters adapt a Light, medium, heavy button system. This involves a light punch and a light kick. LP (Light Punch), MP (Medium Punch), HP (Heavy Punch) and the same set for kicks, LK, MK, HK. Other games such as the Marvel vs Capcom series use a different system - a light, medium, heavy and launcher. 
	So following the 236 motion you would be required to push a button - 'A'. A is usually the light attack in most notations but it varies between games.

	The one fighting game engine that I put the most time into was Skullgirls. One of the characters that I played was Peacock and she used this motion in different ways.

		This attack has three different variants. The 236 A version or light version in the original Skullgirls game had invincibility frames. This move has frames where when active the character Peacock cannot get hit.
		The 236 B version or medium version of the attack. This version of the attack had throw invincibility. This meant for a few frames this move was invincible to throws, including super throws that required meter.
