	# After installing Hugo [here](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo/releases)
	
I first generated a site by going into the command line, GitBash, and navigated to the destination I wanted the files for the site.

<h1> Creating the site </h1>
The folder I created was going to be called assn2, so I once I was in the CS120-repo, I used "hugo newsite assn2".
The hugo quick start page mentions using "hugo newsite quickstart" but that only changes the folder the site is to being named quickstart.
Once hugo finishes generating the page it was recommended to use a theme. 

<h2> Adding the theme </h2>
There is a directory of themes that hugo can use [over here](https://themes.gohugo.io)
The theme I used was Kube
